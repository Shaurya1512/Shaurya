## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{UQesoZK3_ePyokH1QSYiZqrHNHa.QX4QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

This challenge required invoking a program by providing its path on the command line. In this case, we'll be giving the exact path.

```
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /var/lib/apt/lists directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /var/lib/apt/lists
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/var/lib/apt/lists$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UQesoZK3_ePyokH1QSYiZqrHNHa.QX4QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that there is a whole mess of other directories, configuration files, and programs. We can invoke the /filename, which would give the contents of it. Change directories using 'cd' prompt.
