# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to invoke a program by providing its path on the command line.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{wbVS9HDiroBGIh7nNgSM4UshJm7.QX4cTO0wCM3AzNzEzW}

This challenge required invoking a program by providing its path on the command line. In this case, we'll be giving the exact path, starting from /, so the path would be /pwn.
This style of path, one that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".

```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wbVS9HDiroBGIh7nNgSM4UshJm7.QX4cTO0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that the filesystem starts at /. Under that, there is a whole mess of other directories, configuration files, and programs. We can invoke the /filename, which would give the contents of it.
