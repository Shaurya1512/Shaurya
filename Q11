# Intro To Arguments
This challenge demonstrates why you must use a relative path like './' to run an executable file located in your current directory.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{Qo8Hew4kfZQSv6H6BrYAyAiwUxq.QXxUTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

My first step was to navigate there with cd /challenge. By using the relative path './run'. This command worked perfectly and gave me the flag.

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Qo8Hew4kfZQSv6H6BrYAyAiwUxq.QXxUTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that './' is the standard and necessary way to execute a program that resides in your current working directory.
