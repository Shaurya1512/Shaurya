# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to use the up and down arrow keys to get the history of the terminal.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{0zGI9SFGGu9QTRPtcUAWK0AE7sv.0lNzEzNxwCM3AzNzEzW}
This challenge required using the up arrow key to get the flag, which was stored in the terminal's history. This was the correct input to solve the challenge and retrieve the flag.

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{0zGI9SFGGu9QTRPtcUAWK0AE7sv.0lNzEzNxwCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that the terminal stores the commands in the history and can be retrieved easily by using the arrow keys, rather than typing them again.
