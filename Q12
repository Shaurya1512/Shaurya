# Intro To Arguments
This challenge involved using the tilde (~) character as a shorthand to create a valid file path that meets specific length and location constraints.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{kFZXcG8hLxVYbKdngT5sV-dkcGl.QXzMDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}

I constructed the argument ~/a. This argument is exactly three characters long. Run '/challenge/run ~/a', to have the flag written to the file named a inside my home directory.

```
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{kFZXcG8hLxVYbKdngT5sV-dkcGl.QXzMDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that the utility of the tilde (~) is a powerful shortcut for the home directory. I learned that this is a shell feature called tilde expansion, which happens before the command is executed. This means the program itself sees the full, absolute path, even though I typed a short, convenient argument.
