# Intro To `cat`
The challenge introduces the `cat` command, a fundamental utility in Linux used for reading and displaying file contents.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{UQsf41TxFrPNagJTNq2doJrCv_k.QXxcTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

I used the `cat` command followed by the filename. The command read the file's contents and printed them directly to the terminal, revealing the flag.

```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{UQsf41TxFrPNagJTNq2doJrCv_k.QXxcTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned the primary function of the `cat` command, which is to display the contents of a file. I also understood that its name, short for "concatenate," hints at its ability to combine and display multiple files sequentially if given more than one argument. This challenge focused on its most basic and frequent application: viewing a single file.
