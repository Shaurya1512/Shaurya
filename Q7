# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to change the directory and further navigate till the required file using 'cd' command.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{g3j0xP6hdoCLFcCdVQaaV8JXbw2.QX3QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

This challenge required invoking a program by first changing the directory by putting the exact path of the file using 'cd' and then opening the specific file by providing its path on the command line.

```
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{g3j0xP6hdoCLFcCdVQaaV8JXbw2.QX3QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that we can get to the file by exactly going through the path using the 'cd' prompt.
