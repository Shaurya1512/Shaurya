# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to invoke a program that is itself in a directory by providing its path on the command line.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{0P9ojnZnZOGxtjVRkFpnJ1ssVXb.QX1QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

This challenge required invoking a program by providing its path on the command line. In this case, we'll be starting from /, then open the 'challenge' directory, where we further access the 'run' program. So, the path would be /challenge/run.

```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0P9ojnZnZOGxtjVRkFpnJ1ssVXb.QX1QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that the filesystem starts at /. Under that, there is a whole mess of other directories, configuration files, and programs. We can invoke the /directory/filename, which would give the contents of it.
