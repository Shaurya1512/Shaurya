# Introduction to Globbing: The * Wildcard
This challenge introduces globbing, a feature where the shell interprets special characters like * as wildcards to match filenames. 
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{Mbj09ihiC4gnYrknkBSW1V1nVwk.QXxIDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}

The goal was to change the directory to /challenge using a cd argument of four characters or less. The full path /challenge is too long. I used the * wildcard to create the short pattern /c*, which is only three characters. Since /challenge is the only directory in the root (/) that starts with the letter 'c', the shell correctly expanded this pattern to /challenge. After successfully changing directories, I ran the run executable to get the flag.

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /c*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Mbj09ihiC4gnYrknkBSW1V1nVwk.QXxIDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned that the shell performs globbing to expand patterns containing special characters into matching filenames. The * wildcard is the most common, matching any sequence of characters. This is an incredibly powerful tool for working with multiple files at once (e.g., rm *.tmp) or, as shown in this challenge, for creating a short and convenient way to specify a unique file or directory name.

# Globbing with the ? Wildcard
This challenge introduces the ? globbing character, which acts as a wildcard that matches exactly one character. 
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{Qu3st10n_M4rks_M4tch_1_Ch4r}

The task was to navigate to the /challenge directory, but the cd command's argument had to use ? in place of the letters 'c' and 'l'. The ? wildcard matches any single character, so I constructed the pattern /?ha??enge to match /challenge.
The shell correctly expanded this pattern, allowing me to change into the correct directory. Once there, I executed the run program to get the flag.

```

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gjIzng0gaUOzGaX3EkYnDKK0f5N.QXyIDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned that the ? wildcard is used in shell globbing to match exactly one of any character. This makes it more precise than the * wildcard, which matches any number of characters. The ? is useful when you need to match filenames that have a fixed length but vary by a few characters, like image_0?.png which would match image_01.png through image_09.png but not image_10.png.

# Globbing with Character Classes
This challenge introduces character classes using square brackets, a globbing feature that matches any single character from a specified set. 
## My Solve
Flag: 

The task was to run an executable with a single globbing argument that would expand to four specific files: file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h. To do this, I used a character class that contained the unique final letter of each target file.
The pattern file_[bash] instructs the shell to find all files that start with file_ and are followed by exactly one character from the set b, a, s, or h. The shell expanded this single pattern into the four required filenames and passed them to the run program.

```

```

## What I Learned
I learned that square brackets [] create a character class in shell globbing, matching any single character that is explicitly listed inside them. This provides more control than the ? wildcard (which matches any character) and more flexibility than a literal character.

This feature also supports ranges, such as [a-z] to match any lowercase letter or [0-9] to match any digit, making it a very powerful tool for creating precise file matching patterns.

# Globbing with Absolute Paths
This challenge demonstrates that globbing patterns can be applied to entire file paths, not just files in the current directory. üõ£Ô∏è
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{wG9CHjh5NGYvI0HTkT6DMJqzlsr.QX0IDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}

The task was to run the /challenge/run program from my home directory with a single argument that expands into the absolute paths of four specific files located in /challenge/files.
To do this, I constructed a globbing pattern that included the full path prefix. The pattern /challenge/files/file_[bash] specified the absolute path to the files, with a character class [bash] to match the unique final letter of each target file. The shell expanded this single argument into the four required absolute paths, passing them to the program.

```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wG9CHjh5NGYvI0HTkT6DMJqzlsr.QX0IDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned that globbing works on any part of a path. The shell will expand a wildcard pattern whether it's for a local file (*.txt) or a full absolute path (/usr/share/doc/*-base/README). This makes globbing an extremely versatile tool for scripting and interacting with files located anywhere on the filesystem, regardless of your current working directory.

# Advanced Globbing: Substring Matching
This challenge demonstrates how to use multiple * wildcards in a single pattern to match files containing a specific substring. üåü

## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{E0ErAD8tsruliidiTExtUvUbCPp.0lM3kjNxwCM3AzNzEzW}

The goal was to provide a single, short (3 characters or less) globbing argument to the run program that would expand to all files in the directory containing the letter 'p'.
The solution was the pattern *p*. This three-character glob works because the first * matches any sequence of characters (or nothing) before the letter 'p', and the second * matches any sequence of characters (or nothing) after it. This effectively selects every filename that has a 'p' anywhere in it.

```
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{E0ErAD8tsruliidiTExtUvUbCPp.0lM3kjNxwCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned a powerful and common globbing idiom: using the pattern *keyword* to perform a substring match. This is the standard way to find any file or directory that contains a specific word or character sequence anywhere in its name. This technique is fundamental for efficiently searching, listing, and manipulating groups of files on the command line.

# Combining Globbing Techniques
This challenge is a practical exercise in combining multiple globbing concepts to create a single, precise pattern that matches a specific set of files. üß©

## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{UVLxwnY_OCrQdvZ68tMp4Dbnig6.QX1IDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}

The goal was to craft a single glob pattern, six characters or less, that would expand to match only "challenging", "educational", and "pwning".
The key was to identify the unique starting letter of each of the three files: c, e, and p. By creating a character class with these three letters, the pattern [cep]* perfectly isolates the target files. This glob tells the shell to match any file that begins with 'c', 'e', or 'p', followed by any number of other characters.

```
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{UVLxwnY_OCrQdvZ68tMp4Dbnig6.QX1IDO0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```
## What I Learned
I learned that when crafting a precise globbing pattern, finding the most restrictive common feature is crucial. In this case, the unique starting letter of each file was a much more reliable identifier than a common internal letter. Using a character class at the beginning of a pattern, like [cep]*, is a powerful technique for selecting files from a specific, known set while excluding others.

Globbing with Negated Character Classes [^...]
This challenge introduces negated character classes, a globbing feature used to match files that do not contain certain characters. üö´

My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{N3g4t10n_1s_P0w3rful}

The task was to run an executable with an argument that expands to all files in the directory, except for those starting with 'p', 'w', or 'n'. To accomplish this, I used a negated character class.

The pattern [^pwn]* tells the shell to match any file that begins with a character that is not 'p', 'w', or 'n', followed by any number of other characters. This successfully filtered out the unwanted files and passed the correct list to the run program.

Bash

hacker@globbing~negation:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~negation:/challenge/files$ ./run [^pwn]*
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{N3g4t10n_1s_P0w3rful}
What I Learned
I learned that placing a caret (^) or an exclamation mark (!) as the first character inside a globbing bracket ([]) inverts the match. Instead of matching any character inside the set, it matches any character not in the set. This is a powerful technique for exclusion, allowing you to easily select all files except for a specific few.
