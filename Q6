# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to change the directory using 'cd' command.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{I4asR9rjwGx3eyHhr7YwD76mp6I.QX2QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

This challenge required invoking a program by first changing the directory using 'cd' and then opening the specific file by providing its path on the command line.

```
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /sys/kernel directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /sys/kernel
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/sys/kernel$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I4asR9rjwGx3eyHhr7YwD76mp6I.QX2QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that the Linux filesystem has tons of directories with tons of files. You can navigate around directories by using the 'cd' (change directory) command and passing a path to it as an argument.
