# Intro To Arguments
The challenge asks you to invoke the commands.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{4_nkpds_dPZyr1_vkLQYuoRTNCv.QX3-YjM1wCM3AzNzEzW}

To solve this, I first used the whoami command to check the current user. Afterwards, I simply executed the hello program without any arguments, which successfully printed the flag to the terminal.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4_nkpds_dPZyr1_vkLQYuoRTNCv.QX3YjM1wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned that the whoami command shows the current username.

## References
None.
