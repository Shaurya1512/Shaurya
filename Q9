# Intro To Arguments
The challenge requires running an executable using a relative path instead of an absolute one.
## My Solve
Flag: pwn.college{srPKKur444UUhtIi8uHby3NgrCi.QX5QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}

I needed to understand the difference between an absolute path and a relative path. An absolute path always starts from the root directory (e.g., /challenge/run), while a relative path starts from your current working directory.
The task was to run the executable located at /challenge/run from the root directory (/) using a relative path. I started by changing my current working directory to the root directory with the command cd /. From the root directory, the relative path to the executable is simply challenge/run. Executing this path successfully ran the program and gave me the flag.

```
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{srPKKur444UUhtIi8uHby3NgrCi.QX5QTN0wCM3AzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
Through this task, I understood that this challenge demonstrated that the interpretation of a relative path depends entirely on your current working directory (cwd).
